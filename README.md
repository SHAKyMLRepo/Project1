![House Prediction](Images/house.jpg)

## Introduction

The real estate market is a dynamic and complex environment, and predicting house prices accurately is a valuable tool for homeowners, buyers, and real estate professionals. This project aims to explore the links between property prices, population and population density. It aims to try and establish the degree of correlation between such factors and determine if it is possible to estimate how house prices will behave into the future based on factors such as land area, population and population density.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: The primary objective of this project is to create a House Price Prediction algorithms that employs Linear Regression to estimate the selling price of houses based on the available land space in a region and its population density.

## Key Components

### Data Sourcing 
<br>
In this project, I sourced publically available datasets with the necessary information required to begin to develop the inputs for this project. This proved to be a challenging task as while there is plenty of high quality data on Irish Population statistics, due to privacy concerns many of the publically avaiable datasets regarding House Prices cannont contain any PII so have many of the fields you might wish for to answer these questions removed or lowered in fidelity to protect privacy. In the end, a number of seperate datasets were required to collate the fields necessary for the project.

**Datasets**:
1. **FY001: Population by each census by Sex and County, 1841 to 2022**
     - **Description** This dataset, named FY001, was sourced from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) datasets. It provides comprehensive population data recorded during every Census conducted from 1841 to 2022. The dataset includes population statistics categorized by sex and county.
     - **Usage**: This dataset was crucial for obtaining accurate and detailed population statistics, which were essential for understanding how population dynamics over time may correlate with other Housing Price factors. The main fields used were the Census Year, County and Population figure.

### Data Preprocessing
As this project could not use a prepared dataset as none was available with the information required regarding the Irish market, the Data Preprocessing stage was one of the most involved stage of this project. This involved tasks such as handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and removing unneeded data. As multiple datasets had to be combined it also required datasets formats to be synchronised before combination. The goal was to prepare the data for model development by ensuring it was clean and structured. For the data preparation, the Pandas and NumPy libraries were used.

Access the preprocessing code [here](https://github.com/SHAKyMLRepo/Project1-HousePricePrediction/blob/main/DataPreprocessing/DataProcessing.ipynb).

1. **Read Data**: At this stage, each csv was transformed into a Panda DataFrame respecting the various encoding standards.
2. **Data Exploration**: An initial exploration of the data was performed to establish the data types included and what were the necessary steps to form the final needed dataset for analysis. The .info() and .describe() methods were used to form a picture of a summary of the datasets included and some basic statistics.
3. **Data Cleaning**:

#### Residential Property Price Index 2010 - 2023
-**Removing Null Rows**: Rows with missing values were identified and removed. This was done to ensure data completeness and integrity.
- **Filtering by Specific Value**: A subset of the dataset containing properties marked with "Not Full Market Price" was created. This was used to isolate properties whose price may not be representative of their market price. These rows were thus removed for data integrity reasons.
- **Handling VAT Exclusivity**: Properties marked as "VAT Exclusive" had their prices adjusted to account for their VAT exclusion. The VAT added was 13.5% which is the VAT price for house sales in Ireland.
- **Data Type Conversion**: The "Date of Sale (dd/mm/yyyy)" column was converted to a datetime format for accurate date-based analysis.
- **Renaming Columns**: The column name "Date of Sale (dd/mm/yyyy)" was renamed to "Date of Sale" for clarity.
- **Address Cleaning**: Extra spaces and non-string data types were removed from the "Address" column to ensure consistency.
- **Price Column Cleaning**: Euro symbols and commas in the "Price (â‚¬)" column were removed, and the column was renamed to "Price." The data type was changed to float for numerical analysis.
- **Language Standardisation**: Columns "Description of Property" and "Property Size Description" were cleaned and standardized. This involved translating Irish descriptions to English and removing irregular or non-standard entries.
- **Splitting Data**: The dataset was filtered to include only new build properties as only these properties contained size descriptions which were needed for the later analsysis
- **Data Binning**: Dates were split into quarters to align with the fiscal quarters and facilitate time-based analysis. This was found not to join to other datasets well so was removed.
- **Data Transformation** : Unnecessary columns, including "Date of Sale," "Address," "Eircode," and "Description of Property," were removed from the DataFrame.
- **Standardise Capitalisation**: County values were capitalised to facilitate later merge conditions.
- **Removed Second Hand House Rows**: Second hand houses were removed from dataset as they did not contain house size data which would skew results.

#### Residential Property Prices for Ireland (QIEN628BIS)
- **Normalization**: Data normalization was applied to the "QIEN628BIS" column from the secondary dataset. This ensured that values were on a common scale for meaningful analysis and comparison.

#### FY001: Population by each census by Sex and County, 1841 to 2022
- **Filling Missing Values**: As the census has a varying number of gaps between data points, missing values were created by taking the previous and next population number and dividing it by the number of years between available census data.
```python
#Start and End
start_year = 1841
end_year = 2022

#Loop through years and check if exists
for year in range(start_year, end_year):
     #If all values nulls
    check = census[census['CensusYear'] == year].isnull().all()
    if check['CensusYear'] == True:
        #Create new rows for previous year
        new_rows = census[census['CensusYear'] == year-1].copy()
        #Set VALUE to 0
        new_rows['VALUE'] = 0
        #Set Year to +1
        new_rows['CensusYear'] = year
        new_rows
        #Now add to census
        census = pd.concat([census, new_rows])

# Sort by 'CensusYear' if needed
census = census.sort_values(by='CensusYear')

# Reset index
census = census.reset_index(drop=True)  
```
```
# Find the years with missing and non-missing years
missing_years = census[census['VALUE'] == 0]['CensusYear'].unique()
years = census[census['VALUE'] != 0]['CensusYear'].unique()

# Find the counties
counties = census[census['VALUE'] != 0]['County'].unique()

# Iterate through the counties
for county in counties:
    # Iterate through the missing years
    for missing_year in missing_years:

        # Find the closest previous and next years
        previous_years = years[years < missing_year]
        next_years = years[years > missing_year]

        #Account for end and beginning
        previous_year = previous_years.max() if previous_years.size > 0 else None
        next_year = next_years.min() if next_years.size > 0 else None

        #So if neither are none
        if previous_year and next_year:
            # Get previous and next values
            previous_value = census[(census['CensusYear'] == previous_year) & (census['County'] == county)]['VALUE'].values[0]
            next_value = census[(census['CensusYear'] == next_year) & (census['County'] == county)]['VALUE'].values[0]

            # Calc gap and gap value
            gap = next_year - previous_year
            gap_value = next_value - previous_value
            #Calc missing value
            filled_value = previous_value + (gap_value / gap) * (missing_year - previous_year)

            # Insert missing value
            census.loc[(census['CensusYear'] == missing_year) & (census['County'] == county), 'VALUE'] = filled_value

```
    
#### Combining Datasets
- **House Price Inflation Integration**: Property Price dataset was combined with QIEN628BIS on the "Year" and "Quarter" columns, ensuring that relevant economic data was added to property records.
- **Census Data Integration**: Data from the census dataset was joined on "CensusYear" and "County" columns into output dataset adding Population data.
- **County Area Integration**: County Area dataset was joined on "County" fields to add areas of county. This was added to calculate population density per county.
- **Average House Prices**: Average House Prices dataset was joined on "County, Year" fields. This was added to gain more data on average house prices over the yeasr.

#### Changes to combined dataset before final output
- **House Prices adjusted by House Size**: A column was added that adjusted house prices by house size to eliminate size difference from training data.
- **Population Density Normalised Column**: A column was added with normalised population density between 0 and 1 due to large disparity between Dublin and other counties.

These merges resulted in a comprehensive dataset that combined property details, economic indicators, and population statistics.
